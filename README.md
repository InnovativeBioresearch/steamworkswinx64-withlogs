# steamworkswinx64-withlogs

A modified version of [steamworks.js](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js) with additional logging for Windows x64, including environment details, DLL loading, and Steam API initialization, and expanded P2P networking capabilities. This module enhances your Steamworks integration with detailed diagnostics and a new `closeP2PSession` API for seamless multiplayer session management, perfect for developers building robust Steam games. Written by Jonathan Fior at Innovative Bioresearch. 

## Features 

- **Enhanced Logging**: Uses winapi to log the exact path of the loaded steam_api64.dll, along with environment details and Steam API initialization, to diagnose issues like [ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED] (e.g., Rust: Found steam_api64.dll at: "C:\...\node_modules\steamworkswinx64-withlogs\dist\win64\steam_api64.dll", Rust: SteamAPI_Init succeeded).
- **New P2P Session Control**: Introduces closeP2PSession (new in v0.0.3), a custom export missing from steamworks.js, enabling seamless P2P session cleanup for buttery-smooth multiplayer. Powered by the Rust steamworks crate’s Networking::close_p2p_session.
- **Windows x64 Only**: Optimized exclusively for Windows x64, ensuring compatibility with `steamworksjs.win32-x64-msvc.node` and the customized `steam_api64.dll`.
- **Pre-Built Binaries**: Ships with all necessary files, including `dist\win64\steam_api64.dll`, `steam_api64.lib`, and `steamworksjs.win32-x64-msvc.node`, so no `npm install` is required for dependencies to use the module in your project.
- **Rebuild Support**: Includes source files (`src`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.js`, `sdk/redistributable_bin`) for users who want to rebuild the module using `npm run build`, though this is optional as pre-built binaries are provided.
- **Steam Overlay Support**: Retains `electronEnableSteamOverlay` for potential future use, though not currently recommended due to known issues (not enabled by default in example usage).
- **Full Steamworks API**: Provides access to all `steamworks.js` features, including achievements, matchmaking, networking, and more, as detailed in the [steamworks.js documentation](https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js).

## Installation 

The module includes all required files for immediate use on Windows x64. No additional npm install is needed to use the module, as it includes pre-built binaries. The pre-built dist\win64 files (dist\win64\steam_api64.dll, dist\win64\steam_api64.lib, dist\win64\steamworksjs.win32-x64-msvc.node) ensure the module works immediately on Windows x64 without additional installations for runtime use. Build is also not needed. 

To install in your project:

```bash
npm install steamworkswinx64-withlogs
```

## Usage

```bash

const steamworks = require('steamworkswinx64-withlogs');

// Initialize Steamworks with your App ID
const steam = steamworks.init(XXXXXXX); // Replace with your Steam App ID

// Example: Unlock an achievement
steam.achievement.activate('ACH_TEST');
console.log('Activated achievement: ACH_TEST');
console.log('Achievement ACH_TEST status:', steam.achievement.isActivated('ACH_TEST') ? 'Unlocked' : 'Locked');

// Note: Avoid calling steamworks.electronEnableSteamOverlay() until overlay issues are resolved
